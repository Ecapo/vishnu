How to set up TMS testing environnement in project root CMakeList:

We need at least two vishnu users with two different local accounts. 

// The vishnu root user must have an admin privilege in the Batch server
// machine. Set his login an his ssh private key path

TEST_ROOT_LOGIN: ""
TEST_ROOT_SSHKEY: ""


// The vishnu admin user does not necessary have any privilege on Batch server
// machine. Set his login an his ssh private key path

TEST_ADMIN_LOGIN: ""

// This user is a normal vishnu user.
// machine. Set his login an his ssh private key path
