      <para>
	All VISHNU users needs to be authenticate by the user management services before using VISHNU. In this way, all users must be added by 
	a VISHNU administrator. The new VISHNU user receives userId and password by email. The password is temporary and must be changed at the first 
	connection.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	After user registration by an administrator, the first step is the connection to VISHNU. The connection parameters are very important as it defined
	the way to close the session automatically on timeout or on disconnect (from the terminal). When these parameters are set, the users can used all VISHNU commands
	within the session created.
